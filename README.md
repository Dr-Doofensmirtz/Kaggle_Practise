The projects on Kaggle datasets

## 1. Pneumonia Detection 
      * The dataset contains chest X-ray images.
      * The task is to create a model that can detect whether the patient has Pneumonia or not.
      * Model used here is of CNN(Convolution Neural Network) architecture.
      * Tensorflow 2.1 is used for training and testing the model.
      * training accuracy : 93.24%
      * validation accuracy : 94%
      * testing accuracy : 88.4%
